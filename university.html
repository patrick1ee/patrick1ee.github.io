                                        <li>Implemented a power analysis attack in Python based on the Correlation Power Analysis attack described by Brier et al. and making use of
                                            the Pico oscilloscope. This was successful in recovering the entire encryption key from an AES implementation running on the SCALE 
                                            micro-controller.

                                        <li>Dramatically increased the speed of this attack by using einstein summations to correlate matrices, 
                                            taking the analysis time down from several minutes to several seconds 
                                            meaning the entire attack, including trace acquisition, took ~ 2 minutes

                                        <li>Implemented a successful countermeasure to this attack in C based on both randomly disaligning the order of operation on the encryption state and 
                                            additive masking, with the encryption functionality running within an efficiency budget of 100ms

                                        <li>Analysed the performance and efficiency of each component of the countermeasure as well as the 
                                            trade-off between efficiency and the memory constraints of the device

                                        <li>Designed and built our own drum MIDI controllers using pizeo sensors, an arduino controller and LED lights, using a laser cutter to

                                        <li>Implemented the ability for the game to read in music from audio files and parse it into a series of timestamped notes

                                        <li>Replaced the existing Unity Kinect library with our own version, allowing for a single Kinect camera to track multiple bodies seperately.

                                        <li>Implemented the ability for a variety of trees to grow completely procedurally, with each one being completely unique in both appearance and its growth animation.
                                            This was based on research by Jinmo Kim with modifications to fit our needs

                                            Developed our game so that it could be played in a 270 degree immersive tent, using three screens to give the illusion of virtual reality. This required 
                                            further optimisations as the game would effectively have to produce three different renders on every frame.

                                        which their druid avatars, reflecting the movements of the players from the Kinect, will fly around on a platform.

                                        <li>Used a randomized search to find optimal hyper-parameters for this nerual network and assessed which hyper-parameters had the largest overall effect on performance

                                        <li>Fit a support vector machine to this dataset and performed hyper-parameter tuning and analysis, similar to with the neural network</li>
                                        <li>Used Bayesian linear regression to predict median house value from the California Housing dataset, using the Hamiltonian Markov Chain Monte Carlo to obtain posterior
                                            distributions for each model parameter, and assessing performance in comparison to least squares regression and when fitted to different sample sizes.

                                        <li>Used a grid search to tune the hyper-parameters of a CART decision tree for use with the California Housing dataset, analysing each parameters effect on model performance

                                        <li>Analysed the difference in accuracy of the tuned CART decision tree with that of Bayesian linear regression for the same dataset

                                        <li>Analysed the tradeoff of number of estimators with training time for a Random Forest Regressor</li>
